# CS210-Project-1-Clock
This repository is for the CS210 Module Eight Assignment.

Question: Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
Answer: For this project, Chada Tech wants their clients to be able to view a 12 and a 24 hour clock on their website rather than just the standard 12-hour clock. To stand out as a top candidate, you will need to apply program logic by creating two clocks that display simultaneously and allow for user input using secure and efficient C++ code.
Question: What did you do particularly well?
Answer: For this project I thought I did rather well with planning out my code and seeing the outcome when executing the code. I did have to fix a few bugs that I encountered along the way, but was able to fix them. Keeping notes on what code was working and was not working really helped.
Question: Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
Answer: 
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
