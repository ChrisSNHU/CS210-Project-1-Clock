# CS210-Project-1-Clock
This repository is for the CS210 Module Eight Assignment.

Question: Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

Answer: For this project, Chada Tech wants their clients to be able to view a 12 and a 24 hour clock on their website rather than just the standard 12-hour clock. To stand out as a top candidate, you will need to apply program logic by creating two clocks that display simultaneously and allow for user input using secure and efficient C++ code.

Question: What did you do particularly well?

Answer: For this project I thought I did rather well with planning out my code and seeing the outcome when executing the code. I did have to fix a few bugs that I encountered along the way, but was able to fix them. Keeping notes on what code was working and was not working really helped.

Question: Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

Answer: To enhance my code, I believe I would try improving the format of the output for better readability. It would make the code more efficient by having a clearer output.

Question: Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

Answer: This project as well as the other projects in this course I found challenging. I had to spend quite a bit of time reading and re-reading ZyBooks to refresh my memory to be sure I was doing the code correctly. One tool I did find helpful was the Instant Feedback Tool that was included in the module. If there was something that seemed out of place or if the code was wrong, the feedback in the tool would let me know and show me what needed worked on. 

Question: What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

Answer: This project gave me a better perspective and understanding of functions and using different functions together. Functions are a core part of programming and I think that they will transfer over to other courses and projects.

Question: How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Answer: I tried my best to not to over complicate the code. I tried to keep the code up to the industry standards as best as I could. Following along with the proper guidelines to keep the code looking clean and avoiding redundant code made it easier to read, maintanable, and adaptable.
